<h1>IMMERSE Summer 2007</h1>

IMMERSE is a program of the <a href="http://www.unl.edu">University of Nebraska</a>
<a href="http://www.math.unl.edu">Department of Mathematics</a>.
From the <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/programs/mctp/immerse.shtml">IMMERSE</a> home page:
<blockquote cite="http://www.math.unl.edu/programs/mctp/immerse.shtml">
Nebraska IMMERSE is the centerpiece of the Department's MCTP program.
IMMERSE has two interweaving components: one that strengthens the preparation of students
who are about to enter their first year of graduate study in mathematics (these students
are referred to as "pre-grads"), and one that develops the teaching, research, and mentoring
skills of graduate students and early-career faculty.

<p>For the pre-grads, the main component of the program consists of two intensive courses:
one in algebra and one in analysis. The courses will be at the advanced undergraduate/beginning
graduate level. However, rather than working through a textbook, the courses will be structured
around the reading of research papers. The IMMERSE course coordinators (two UNL faculty) will
select papers that use as tools some of the topics which typically appear in first-year
graduate algebra and analysis courses, and then structure the IMMERSE courses around the
material of the papers. Each course is team-taught by a pair of early-career faculty, with
a mixed group of three first-year and advanced graduate students serving as teaching assistants.

The director of the summer 2007 IMMERSE program
was <a href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~tmarley1/">Tom Marley</a>, UNL.
The course began June 25 and ended August 2.
