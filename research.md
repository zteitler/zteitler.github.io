# Research

My area of research is
[commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra)
and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry)
([MSC](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html) 13 and 14).

I am interested in a range of problems involving commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry, usually with a combinatorial or computational flavor,
such as:
computing rank (especially **Waring rank**), [**secant varieties**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_variety),
and [Hilbert functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_series_and_Hilbert_polynomial);
arrangements (of [hyperplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_hyperplanes),
[lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement_of_lines), points, etc);
[**multiplier ideals**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_ideal) (computation, applications to commutative algebra);
and computer experimentation in mathematics.

My dissertation was titled "Multiplier Ideals of Line Arrangements".
I computed the multiplier ideals of general arrangements of lines through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^3$,
and even for "most" special arrangements.
I studied under [Rob Lazarsfeld](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~roblaz/) at University of Michigan.
