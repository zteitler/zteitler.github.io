**Teaching**
: I teach a range of courses,
  mostly upper-level proof-based (or "pure math") courses for undergraduate and graduate math majors.
  I also frequently teach introduction to proofs, multivariable calculus, differential equations,
  and occasionally other classes such as linear algebra.  
  
  #### Spring 2025:  
  Mathematical Proofs and Methods (Math 287)  
  Real Analysis (Math 414/514)  
  
  #### [Previous and upcoming courses](/teaching)

**Research**
: [Publications](/research)  

: My area of research is
  [commutative algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_algebra)
  and [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry)
  ([MSC](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2020.html) 13 and 14).  
  I study algebraic geometry with actual polynomials,
  especially **Waring rank**.


**Advising**
: [Graduate and undergraduate students I have advised](/advising).


**TATERS**
