<dt>Respect for Diversity:</dt>
<dd><p>Students from all backgrounds and with all perspectives are welcome in this course. It is my intent that all students be well served by this course, that students's learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to maintain a classroom atmosphere that is welcoming and respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. </p></dd>
