        <title>Components of course grade</title>
        <p>
          Graded student work will consist of
          a short paper and a term paper, midterm and final exams, and written homework.
          Course grades will be based primarily on term papers and exams,
          and to a lesser extent on homework.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection>
        <title>Papers</title>
        <p>
          Each student will write two papers for this class.
          Each paper is intended to provide:
          <ul>
            <li>
              an opportunity to explore the mathematical research literature
              and seek a personally appealing research topic
            </li>
            <li>
              an authentic experience of working with the published
              mathematical literature
            </li>
            <li>
              an authentic experience of writing a substantial mathematical
              text, well beyond typical homework solutions
            </li>
            <li>
              preparation for writing even an larger text,
              such as a thesis
            </li>
            <li>
              an authentic experience of receiving feedback on a draft
              manuscript and responding to that feedback through multiple
              rounds of revision
            </li>
            <li>
              an authentic experience of writing mathematical exposition
              at a high level
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The details of the two papers are as follows.
          <ol>
            <li>
              A short paper about an open question, unsolved problem,
              or currently studied research area within algebra,
              algebraic geometry, or computational algebra,
              or an application of one of those areas.
            </li>
<!--      %The short paper will primarily explain what the question or problem is.
      %Additionally it may include: motivation for the question and connections to other problems in math or applications;
      %history of the question and progress on it so far;
      %relevant examples; heuristic arguments for or against the conjecture;
      %a discussion of why the problem is challenging; etc.
      %However these are optional and the page limit is strict.-->
            <li>
              A term paper about a topic of the student's choice
              within algebra, algebraic geometry, or computational algebra,
              or an application of one of those areas
              (but emphasizing the algebraic aspect).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Lengths and deadlines of the papers are as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The short paper will be 2–3 pages long,
                with the following deadlines:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A topic and source are due by the end of week 3.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A first draft is due by the end of week 4.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The short paper is due by the end of week 5.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The term paper will be 6–15 pages long
                (it can be shorter or longer if needed; please discuss with me),
                with the following deadlines:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A topic (1–2 pages) is due by the end of week 7.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An outline plus one section are due by the end of week 10.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A first draft is due by the end of week 13.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The term paper is due by the end of week 15.

        <title>Midterm and final exams</title>
        <p>
          A midterm exam in the 8th week of the semester, and the final exam,
          will be individual oral exams.
          The exams are intended to gauge mastery of course material,
          but also reflection on the course and its place in a larger context.

        <title>Written homework</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            You are encouraged to work collaboratively on homework but you must
            turn in your own solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homework will contribute to course grades,
            but it is intended primarily to give feedback and guidance
            to students throughout the semester.
          </p>

        <subsubsection>
          <title>Turning in homework</title>
          <p>
            Homework submissions and grading will be paperless.
            You will turn in your homework by uploading PDFs to BlackBoard.
            PDFs should have filenames in the following format:
            <blockquote>
              <c>584-Homework-</c><angles>number</angles><c>-</c><angles>your last name</angles><c>.pdf</c>
            </blockquote>
            For example:
            <c>584-Homework-01-Teitler.pdf</c>.

          <title>Homework formatting</title>
          <p>
            Homework must be typed in <latex />.
            <latex /> tutorials are available online,
            e.g., <url href="https://www.latex-tutorial.com" /> and
            <url href="https://www.gnu.org/software/teximpatient/" />.
            You may wish to use a free online <latex /> system such as
            <url href="https://overleaf.com" />.
            (Overleaf includes a <latex /> tutorial.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Use a new page (<c>\newpage</c>) for each problem.
            State which question you are answering
            (textbook section and exercise number)
            and the actual question.
            Then, start your answer in a new paragraph.
            Use environments such as <c>proof</c> and <c>theorem</c>
            (via <c>\begin{proof}</c><ellipsis /><c>\end{proof}</c>)
            to organize your work and display it clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For legibility, use the <c>12pt</c> option
            (<c>\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}</c>)
            and <c>\linespread{2.4}</c>.
            If you use figures,
            I recommend learning to use <c>TikZ</c> to generate high-quality
            figures within <latex />.
            Alternatively you may use figures/plots generated in other programs
            such as Sage, Mathematica, Maple, or Inkscape, saved to PDF,
            and included in your document with commands
            like <c>\includegraphics</c>.
            It's also fine to include hand-drawn figures that you scanned or
            photoed.

        <title>Allowed resources</title>
        <p>
          In this 500 level class, I expect you to use the full array of
          resources at your disposal to learn the material
          <q>by any means possible.</q>
          For homework assignments, you are encouraged (in fact, expected)
          to collaborate with your classmates and to ask me questions.
          Other resources (books, online sources, people outside the class)
          are highly recommended for clarifying class topics or for enrichment
          (but <em>not</em> for getting solutions to problems).
        </p>
        <p>
          You are allowed to use things that you learn from a book,
          online source, or person outside the class
          that <em>help you and your classmates to find your own solution</em>
          for a problem.
          However, if you read a full solution, so that there's
          little or nothing left for you and your classmates to figure out,
          then you <em>may not turn in that solution for credit</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <url href="https://math.stackexchange.com">Mathematics Stack Exchange</url>
          is a very useful question-and-answer site for undergraduate/graduate
          level mathematics.
          You are welcome to browse the Mathematics Stack Exchange
          and even post questions there.
          Hopefully it will help you learn and understand the material!
          However please remember that if you use that site to get a solution
          to a problem,
          then you can't turn that solution in for credit.
          Other helpful websites for basic information include Wikipedia
          and <url href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com">MathWorld</url>.

        <title>A note on collaboration</title>
        <p>
          Solving mathematical problems has three parts:
          <dl>
            <li>
              <title>The discovery phase:</title>
              <p>
                This is the time you spent trying to figure out how to solve
                the problems,
                and it often takes most of the time.
                You are welcome and encouraged to collaborate
                with other students in this phase.
                Collaboration is a healthy practice,
                and this is how mathematics is done in real life.
              </p>
              <p>
                This phase starts with working to understand what a problem
                or question is asking for.
                That might include reviewing material from previous textbook
                sections.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>The write-up phase:</title>
              <p>
                This consists of writing your solutions once you have an idea
                of how the problem can be solved.
                You should do this entirely by yourself.
                Be alone when you write your solutions.
                If you collaborate on this part,
                or you copy part of your solutions from somebody else,
                or you have notes written by somebody else in front of you
                when you write your solutions,
                you are hurting yourself by depriving yourself
                of an opportunity to learn and practice.
                <!--%and you may also be engaging in academic misconduct.-->
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need help in the write-up phase, talk to me!
                I can help you.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>The editing phase:</title>
              <p>
                This consists of editing and revising your write-up for
                clarity, organization, and presentation.
                At this stage it can be very helpful to get feedback
                and suggestions from other students.

              Every student has the right to a respectful learning environment.
              In order to provide this right to all students, students must take individual responsibility
              to conduct themselves in a mature and appropriate manner
              and will be held accountable for their behavior
