  *Course description*:
  Graph theory is the study of structures such as networks of computers or roads.
  This course focuses on the mathematical theory of graphs;
  applications and algorithms will be discussed as well.
  Basic topics include trees, connectivity, matchings and factors, network flows and cuts,
  vertex and edge colorings, and planar graphs.
  Advanced topics will be drawn from pebbling games, extremal graphs,
  random graphs, and algebraic graph theory.
