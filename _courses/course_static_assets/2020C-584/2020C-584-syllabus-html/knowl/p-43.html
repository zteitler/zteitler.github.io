<p>Solving mathematical problems has three parts:</p>
<dl xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="description-list">
<dt>The discovery phase:</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the time you spent trying to figure out how to solve the problems, and it often takes most of the time. You are welcome and encouraged to collaborate with other students in this phase. Collaboration is a healthy practice, and this is how mathematics is done in real life.</p>
<p>This phase starts with working to understand what a problem or question is asking for. That might include reviewing material from previous textbook sections.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The write-up phase:</dt>
<dd>
<p>This consists of writing your solutions once you have an idea of how the problem can be solved. You should do this entirely by yourself. Be alone when you write your solutions. If you collaborate on this part, or you copy part of your solutions from somebody else, or you have notes written by somebody else in front of you when you write your solutions, you are hurting yourself by depriving yourself of an opportunity to learn and practice. </p>
<p>If you need help in the write-up phase, talk to me! I can help you.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The editing phase:</dt>
<dd><p>This consists of editing and revising your write-up for clarity, organization, and presentation. At this stage it can be very helpful to get feedback and suggestions from other students.</p></dd>
