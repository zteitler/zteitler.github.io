  We give a sufficient condition for the strong symmetric version
  of Strassen's additivity conjecture:
  the Waring rank of a sum of forms in independent variables
  is the sum of their ranks,
  and every Waring decomposition of the sum is a sum of decompositions
  of the summands.
  We give additional sufficient criteria for the additivity of Waring ranks
  and a sufficient criterion for additivity of cactus ranks and decompositions.
